# Change-Highlighter
Highlight changes line by line in your code

The change highlighter highlights changes based on line breaks, so it is especially useful for languages like Python where typically you don't do too much in a single line.

As an example, we are coming back to old caesar cypher code and want to see if it has changed:
<img src="/assets/code.png" width = 400px>

After placing the older version of our code on the left and the newer on the right, we press 'Go' and see that it's been messed with!
<img src="/assets/Code Changed.png" width = 400px>
